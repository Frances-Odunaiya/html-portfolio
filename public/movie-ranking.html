<h2>Below are my 3 most favorites movies this year 2023</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Blood Ties</h3>
<p>
  The spanish series about three sisters trained to avenge their mothers death.
  I love the sisterly bond they share.
</p>
<h3>Blood & Water</h3>
<p>
  This is about a family willing to do everything to find their eldest child who
  was a victim of child trafficking. I love South African movies.
</p>
<h3>BRIDGERTON - Queen Charlotte</h3>
<p>
  This is one of the Bridgerton stories about the mad king. It emphasized the
  love that he shared with his wife during his reign and also how supportive the
  queen was.
